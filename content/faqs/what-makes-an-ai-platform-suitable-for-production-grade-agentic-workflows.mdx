question: What makes an AI platform suitable for production-grade agentic workflows?
answer: >-
  A production-ready AI platform must support end-to-end orchestration, unified
  observability across AI and deterministic steps, strong governance and
  security controls, enterprise system integrations, flexible model choices, and
  rigorous testing and evaluation tools. These capabilities ensure agents can
  operate predictably at scale.
