question: Why do most AI agents fail to reach production?
answer: >-
  Most AI agents fail to reach production not because of model limitations, but
  due to missing operational foundations such as orchestration, observability,
  governance, and system integration. Without these, agents remain isolated
  experiments and cannot deliver consistent, reliable outcomes in real business
  environments.
